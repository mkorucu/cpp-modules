#In C++, both the post-increment and pre-increment operators can be overloaded for a class using the following syntax:
class MyClass {
public:
    // Overloading pre-increment operator
    MyClass& operator++() {
        // Increment the value of the object
        // (here, value is incremented by 1)
        this->value++;
        return *this;
    }

    // Overloading post-increment operator
    MyClass operator++(int) {
        MyClass temp(*this);
        // Increment the value of the object
        // (here, value is incremented by 1)
        this->value++;
        return temp;
    }

private:
    int value;
};

#Here, the operator++() function is used to overload the pre-increment operator, and the operator++(int) function is used to overload the post-increment operator. The int argument in the operator++(int) function is used to differentiate it from the pre-increment operator.

#The overloaded operator++() function returns a reference to the updated object (MyClass&), which allows chaining multiple increment operations. The overloaded operator++(int) function returns a copy of the original object (before incrementing its value). This is because the post-increment operator is expected to return the original value of the object, not the incremented value.

#Inside the overloaded functions, you can increment the value of the object (here, the value member variable) as per your requirement.

#You can use the overloaded pre-increment and post-increment operators as follows:
MyClass obj1;
MyClass obj2 = obj1++;
++obj2;

#Here, obj1++ will call the overloaded post-increment operator, which will increment the value of obj1 by 1 and return a copy of the original obj1 (with the original value). This returned copy is assigned to obj2. The ++obj2 will call the overloaded pre-increment operator, which will increment the value of obj2 by 1 and return a reference to the updated obj2.





#In C++, comparison operators can be overloaded using the following syntax:
class MyClass {
public:
    // Overloading less than operator
    bool operator<(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value < other.value);
    }

    // Overloading greater than operator
    bool operator>(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value > other.value);
    }

    // Overloading less than or equal to operator
    bool operator<=(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value <= other.value);
    }

    // Overloading greater than or equal to operator
    bool operator>=(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value >= other.value);
    }

    // Overloading equality operator
    bool operator==(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value == other.value);
    }

    // Overloading inequality operator
    bool operator!=(const MyClass& other) const {
        return (this->value != other.value);
    }

private:
    int value;
};

#Here, we have overloaded all six comparison operators: less than, greater than, less than or equal to, greater than or equal to, equality, and inequality.

#The overloaded comparison operators take a constant reference to another object of the same class as an argument and return a boolean value. The comparison is made based on the value of a private member variable value.

#You can use the overloaded comparison operators as follows:
MyClass obj1(10);
MyClass obj2(20);

if (obj1 < obj2) {
    // Do something if obj1 is less than obj2
}

if (obj1 == obj2) {
    // Do something if obj1 is equal to obj2
}
